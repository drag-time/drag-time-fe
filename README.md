# Drag Time 

## Abstract

  Drag Time is an application to be used by performers and fans to find and create local drag events. Users can navigate to an event feed, favorite and RSVP to events, and create events. This was a group project completed in the final quarter of Turing's Software Development school. 

## Objectives

  * Coordinate with a backend team to display drag events on a web page.
  * Utilize React, Redux, and React Hooks to render content.
  * Build tests to validate expected functionality.
  * Create a sleek and friendly user interface. 

## Installation Instructions

  1. Clone down this repo to your local machine.
  2. Clone down the [backend repo](https://github.com/drag-time/drag-time-api) to your local machine.
  3. In the root of the frontend directory, run:
  ```
    npm install
    npm start
  ```
  4. In the root of the backend directory, run:

  ```
    mix deps.get
    mix phx.server
  ```
  5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

## Challenges and Difficulties

  * Building out a Redux app from scratch
  * Rendering stateful components 
  * Testing asynchronous actions
  * Syncing back-end with front-end 

## Looking Ahead
  * Access code for entertainers to create event
  * Pagination of events
  * Location identifier 
  * Enabling further React Hooks
  * User login
